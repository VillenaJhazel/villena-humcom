                        <p>Five top trends for 2021 in Artificial Intelligence and Machine
                            Learning (AI/ML) for staying ahead of the curve. What is
                            important for being effective for applying algorithms in coding
                            to utilize data to solve problems?</p>
                        <p>Blockchain, is a technology that uses a sequential set of
                            transactions leaving a defined register of events and process
                            for combining tasks. Fusing AI/ML and blockchain for data
                            solutions is coming.</p>
                        <p>Cloud, is scalable and virtual environments. These are available
                            to set users with no physical location or provision requirement.
                            Cloud creates a different model for IT and data services by not
                            restricting architecture by physical requirements.</p>
                        <p>Ethical Artificial Intelligence, is a field, study, and
                            implementation of framework for limiting or eliminating bias in
                            algorithms. This involves evaluating a solution for data use and
                            implementation for cultural and social impact.</p>
                        <p>Interoperability, using APIs and libraries together through
                            replication or scripting across stacks for easy implementations.
                            Having reusable and expandable blocks for coding across
                            platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, SAP,
                            Snowflake, and more.</p>
                        <p>Security, keeping data safe through stewardship. Both innovation
                            and workflow will be a topic for 2021 to enhance security
                            methods for specialized data services based on Artificial
                            Intelligence and Machine Learning to differentiate from software
                            development norms.</p>
                        <p>The way to stay ahead is to know the list of technologies that
                            touch a domain and achieve proficiency in them for incorporation
                            into tasks to maintain productivity. The five themes for 2021
                            for maintaining relevance in AI/ML: Blockchain, Cloud, Ethical
                            Artificial Intelligence (AI), Interoperability, and Security
                            (Cybersecurity).</p>

                        <p>Institutions, especially in health care, are working to lower
                            the exposure of Covid-19 to patients and workers. Many private and public practices have started implementing more telehealth
                            offerings such as doctor-patient video chats, A.I. avatar-based
                            diagnostics, and no-contact-based medication delivery.</p>
                        <p>Telehealth visits have surged by 50 percent compared with prepandemic levels. IHS Technology predicted that 70 million
                            Americans would use telehealth by 2020. Since then, Forrester
                            Research predicted the number of U.S. virtual care visits will
                            reach almost a billion early in 2021.</p>
                        <p>Teladoc Health, Amwell, Livongo Health, One Medical, and Humana
                            are some of the public companies offering telehealth services to
                            meet the current needs. Startups are not far behind. Startups
                            like MDLive, MeMD, iCliniq, K Health, 98point6, Sense.ly, and
                            Eden Health have also contributed toward meeting the growing
                            needs in 2020, and will continue offering creative solutions in
                            2021. Beyond telehealth, in 2021 we can expect to see health
                            care advancements in biotech and A.I., as well as machine
                            learning opportunities (example: Suki AI) to support diagnosis,
                            admin work, and robotic health care.

                        <p>Educational Technology Trends In 2020-2021
                            Big Data, Machine Learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT)
                            were the biggest educational technology trends of 2019. However,
                            distance learning has become the one trend that rules them all.
                            The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the way we teach
                            and learn. Students now have to get used to distance learning
                            via digital platforms due to social distancing. Even though some
                            schools are reopening, this trend may continue until 2021. The
                            latest EdTech trends in 2020, and further into 2021 are being
                            revolutionized with a strong focus on connectivity, versatility,
                            and student-centered learning. Letâ€™s take a look at the latest
                            top 10 trends in educational technology.</p>
