                <h2>Naomi Scott</h2>
                <h1>Larami Mok</h1>
                <p>Princess Jasmine in Disney’s 2019 Aladdin remake.
                    Born and raised in London, the 26-year-old’s 
                    mother is from Uganda and of Gujarati Indian descent, 
                    while her father is British.
                    She first joined hands with the Disney Channel in 2008 
                    for an Italian series called Life bites. Three years later, 
                    she starred in another Disney production, 
                    a teen musical drama named Lemonade Mouth.
                    As the sixth official Disney Princess, Jasmine
                     is known for her independent character and insistence 
                     on speaking her mind. She is usually associated with feminism. 
                     So Disney had a new song, Speechless, written for the heroine this time, 
                     and Scott convincingly belted that out to show her indignation at the oppression
                      of the royal tradition.
                    Speechless has been viewed more than 17 million times since its release on May 23.</p>

                <h2>Frozen</h2>
                <h1>Disney Wiki</h1>
                <p>Frozen is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated adventure musical fantasy comedy film, 
                    created and produced at Walt Disney Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney 
                    Studios Motion Pictures, directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee. Inspired by the Hans 
                    Christian Andersen fairy tale, The Snow Queen, 
                    it is the 53rd animated feature in the Disney Animated Canon.

                    The story centers fearless optimist Princess Anna, who embarks on a perilous journey to save her kingdom from a curse conjured by her older sister, Queen Elsa. Along the way, she partners up with a misanthropic mountain man, his trusty reindeer, and an enchanted snowman with dreams of experiencing summer. All the while, Anna's dashing fiancé, Prince Hans, has his own plans for the queen and her kingdom.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <h1>Lea Salonga</h1>
                <p>This song is sung by Mulan after she met up with her matchmaker, a disastrous meeting that leads to the matchmaker yelling after her as she flees the pagoda, “You will never bring your family honor!”

                    The song is about how she will never be the girl that her family thinks she truly is, the prim, posh, Chinese bride she is supposed to be, but rather a slightly reckless, adventurous girl. When her hair is up, her lips are red with rouge, and she has white face paint on, she looks in the pond and sees her reflection. She knows that the girl she sees is not who she truly is.</p>
